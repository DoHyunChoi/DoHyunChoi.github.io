When i was kid, i was a liitle boy who couldn't push-up more than 30 and even doesn't know about the any military troops's rank.
Now, I do my military duty finally! for 4years and 4 months including training sessions. I did tough training, I did earn money, I did live myself, and now my personlity is changed. I learn Resopsiblity, Coroporation, Strong mentality. 
I do my best after now. Honestily, I am afraid of new Society.(opposite military corps) But i'm goona to forward cause i have a plan to what i to be. I know there are a lot of risks and frustration, suffer. However, the answer is "Stand it. Turn over the failure and experience success." I hope Everyone around me, my family  got god bless, and Good Luck!

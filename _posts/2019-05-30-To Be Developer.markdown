I actually majored in Computer Science in Ajou University. And keep studying to be a developer. I am interested in IoT, Internet of Things. I can deal with Server, Adoino and Android. but not as well... I hope learning technology applying to machine and Sharing everyone whole of the world. Keep Practicing!
